    "### Getting Steam App IDs and Information\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is dedicated towards collecting a list of all available games on Steam. It uses a public API provided by SteamWorks and sends a GET request, which returns a list of all steam games by ID. It will also download information about games using their app ID and another API. First, import the necessary packages for this code. Running this notebook will begin to download information about all games on Steam to your computer in the same directory. They will be serialized into a pickle object for storage."
